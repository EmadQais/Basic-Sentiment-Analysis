The basic idea of sentiment analysis is to detect the polarity of text documents or short sentences and classify them on this premise. Sentiment polarity is categorized as “positive”, “negative” or “impartial” (neutral). Sentiment analysis can be applied to various sectors such as ecommerce, banking, mining social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and so on. Using sentiment analysis and text mining, organizations can gain consumer insight from the response about their products and services. This can be further used to study customers’ satisfaction with the services and in case of complaints and issues, finding the possible reasons for that.
